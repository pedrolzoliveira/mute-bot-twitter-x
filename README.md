# Mute Bot Twitter/X

For several months now, Twitter/X has been dealing with an issue where bots farm views on popular tweets. These bots often post unrelated content, making it difficult to find comments related to the original tweet.

To address this, I began muting these accounts, which significantly improved my experience when reading comments. However, some farm accounts still slipped through. By using this extension to mute these accounts, you'll see far fewer farm bots, enhancing your experience and helping other users enjoy a cleaner comment section as well.

## Usage

To mute an account, simply click on the more options in the tweet and select `Block with MuteX @userHandle`. Please do not mute accounts that are not farming views, as the extension currently does not filter out genuine accounts from bots.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, feel free to message me on Twitter/X: [@PedrolzOliveira](https://x.com/PedrolzOliveira)
